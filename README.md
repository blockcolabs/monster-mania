## Prerequisites 

#### ‚≠ê Backend
- Copy the content of `.env.default` file to a new `.env` and update the required environment variable(s). Note the following points before updating env variables :
    - We are hosting are database using MongoDB Atlas. So, you'll need to create a new account in MongoDB Atlas and update the `ATLAS_URI` obtained in backend's .env file.
    - `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is required by mongoose-encryption to encrypt passcode and password
    - `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT` is basically the developer username. You can choose any username. Same can be used in .env file of frontend.

#### ‚≠ê Frontend
- Copy the content of `.env.default` file to a new `.env` file and update the required environment variable(s).

#### ‚≠ê BlockCo APIs
- You'll need to request a private key to use BlockCo APIs. You can request key by making a call to 
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"subscription": "FREE"}'  <BLOCKCO_API_URL>/api/v1/developers
```
In response you'll get `private_key` and `id` that you'll need to use in .env file present in backend for DEVELOPER_PRIVATE_KEY and DEVELOPER_ID respectively

<br/>

## Minting Monsters

In order to mint monsters, you'll need to sign up as admin. Use same username as `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT` and enter a suitable password. It'll open a page for you where you can select the monster and number of editions to be minted for that monster. All the monsters will be minted to blockchain account corresponding to `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT`. After you've minted enough NFTs you can logout and then login back as a new user.
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you've minted enough number of monsters before trying out the actual game otherwise game will not work properly 
```
